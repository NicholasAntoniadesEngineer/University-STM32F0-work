The AWD analog watchdog feature is enabled by setting the AWDEN bit in the ADC_CFGR1 register. 
It is used to monitor that either one selected channel or all enabled channels remain within a configured voltage range.
The AWD channel for single channel selected by the AWDCH[4:0] bits.
The AWD analog watchdog status bit is set if the analog voltage converted by the ADC is below a lower threshold or above a higher threshold. 
These thresholds are programmed in the 12 least significant bits of the ADC_HTR and ADC_LTR 16-bit registers. 
An interrupt can be enabled by setting the AWDIE bit in the ADC_IER register.
The AWD flag is cleared by software by writing 1 to it.

----------------------
Single channel set up
----------------------
Set AWDEN bit high to enable AWD.  (ADC1 -> CFGR1 |= 1 << 22)
Set AWDSGL bit high to select signle channel. (ADC1 -> CFGR1 |= 1 << 21)
Set AWDCH[4:0] bits to select channel. (ADC1 -> CFGR1 |= ADC_channel << 25)
Set ADC_HTR high threshholds. (ADC1 -> TR |= ADC_High_threshhold << 15)
Set ADC_LTR low threshhold.  (ADC1 -> TR |= ADC_Low_threshhold)
Set AWDIE bit in ADC_IER to enable the interrupt. (ADC1 -> IER |= 0x80)

-----------------------
AWD interrupt handling
-----------------------
AWD status bit is set if a threshhold has been passed.
AWD status bit must be cleared from the ADC_ISR. (ADC1 -> ISR & 0x80) ==0.

Instead of constantly doing an ADC conversion and checking if the value passess
any of the threshholds. A loop runs to check if the threshhold bit has been set high.
If it has then do something. An actual interrupt does not occur...
